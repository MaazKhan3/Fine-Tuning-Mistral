# Fine-Tuning Mistral

*A project for fine-tuning the Mistral model using QLoRA on the Stratosionosphere and Statlog Heart datasets.*

## Overview

**Fine-Tuning Mistral** is a Python-based project that focuses on optimizing the **Mistral** model for specific tasks using the **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)** technique. The project employs two datasets:  

- **Stratosionosphere Dataset**  
- **Statlog Heart Dataset**  

By leveraging QLoRA, the model achieves efficient fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
